# IAI Seminar
Central place to store code snippets used during seminar presentations

## Contributing

If you have code snippets for your presentation, please use the following steps to add it to the repository. This will ensure everyone in the class can use it for further iteration on their own time.

1. Ask the github repository mainters to add you as a contributer.
2. Clone this git repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:iaisem/iai_seminar.git
```
2. Create a separate branch where you can add your changes.
```
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```
2. Create a folder for your seminar under the corresponding seminar year. For example, if you are part of the 2019 seminar, create a seminar folder under 2019 and add all the required data/code there.
3. Once all the code is added, you can push your changes to github
```
git push origin <branch_name>
```
4. Create a pull request to merge to master on github. You can ask someone to review your PR if required or simply merge it yourselves.
